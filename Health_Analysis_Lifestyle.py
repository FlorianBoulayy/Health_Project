# üìä Integrated Analysis of Mental and Physical Health: Links Between Lifestyle Habits and Biometric Measures

## Understanding the Impact of Lifestyle Habits on Stress, Sleep, and Happiness  

### üìå Project Overview 

In today fast-paced world, mental and physical health are deeply connected to lifestyle choices.

get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'happiness')
get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'being')

To answer these questions, I analyzed the relationship between lifestyle habits and health metrics, using smartwatch data and self-reported mental health information. Through statistical analysis, machine learning, and AI-generated data, I uncovered valuable insights into how stress, sleep, and daily activities shape overall well-being.
During the initial data cleaning process with SQL, I identified missing values, inconsistencies, and structural limitations in the original datasets. To ensure a robust and scalable analysis, I leveraged Artificial Intelligence (AI) to generate a synthetic dataset, carefully preserving the original structure, distributions, and relationships.
This approach allowed me to maintain data integrity while gaining deeper insights into health trends, making the analysis more controlled, precise, and actionable using Python and machine learning

### üîç Research Questions & Objectives 
‚úÖ How does physical activity level impact stress, sleep, and health scores? 
‚úÖ What is the relationship between screen time and happiness? 
‚úÖ How do sleep patterns influence stress levels?  
‚úÖ Which biometric features (heart rate, step count, sleep) are most correlated with stress? 
‚úÖ What are the most important factors for predicting happiness? 

By addressing these questions, this study aims to identify behavioral changes that can improve mental and physical well-being.  


## üìÇ Data Sources & Structure 
This study is based on two datasets, each containing key health and lifestyle variables:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Smartwatch Health Dataset üì≤ 
This dataset includes biometric and activity data collected from wearable devices.  
Variables:  
- User Information: `user_id` (Unique identifier)  
- Biometric Data: `heart_rate_bpm`, `blood_oxygen_pct`, `step_count`, `sleep_duration_hrs`  
- Activity Levels: `activity_level` (Sedentary, Moderate, Active, Highly Active)  
- Stress Metrics: `stress_level` (Scale from 1-10), `stress_category`  
- Health Score Metrics: `health_score` (Scale from 1-15), `health_category`  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Mental Health & Lifestyle Dataset   
This dataset contains self-reported mental health indicators and lifestyle habits.  
Variables:  
- User Demographics: `age`, `gender`, `country`  
- Lifestyle Factors: `diet_type`, `exercise_level`, `work_hours_per_week`, `screen_time_hours`  
- Mental Health Metrics: `stress_level`, `happiness_score`, `mental_health_condition`  
- Social & Behavioral Factors: `social_interaction_score`, `interaction_category`  
- Sleep Data: `sleep_hours`, `sleep_category`  

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology & Workflow
This project follows a structured data science pipeline:

### Stress Level Distribution: Smartwatch vs. Mental Health

Above, we compare how stress levels are distributed in both datasets:
- Smartwatch Health (left): Data captured via wearable devices (heart rate, steps, blood oxygen etc... )
- Mental Health (right): Self-reported data such as sleep hours, age, gender, screen time, happiness etc...

This side-by-side view allows us to see if stress levels follow a similar pattern in device-based measurements versus self-reported measures. Large differences might indicate discrepancies in how users perceive stress compared to biometric indicators.

### Comparing Correlations in Smartwatch vs. Mental Health Datasets

Here, we visualize two separate correlation heatmaps:

1. Smartwatch Dataset (TOP): Focused on biometric/activity metrics ( heart rate, blood oxygen, steps etc). We can see which physiological measures are related (e.g., whether higher step counts correlate with better health scores or lower stress).

2. Mental Health Dataset (BOTTOM): Involves self-reported factors (Hapiness score, sleep hours, screen time etc). This helps us identify if higher screen time correlates with lower happiness, or if more sleep is associated with less stress.

### Four RegPlots: Stress Level vs. Key Variables

Plot 1: Stress Level vs. Heart Rate (Red)
- Shows whether higher stress correlates with elevated average heart rate.  
- Helps confirm if physiological arousal increases as stress goes up.

Plot 2: Stress Level vs. Happiness (Blue)
- Explores if heightened stress is associated with a drop in happiness.  
- Useful for identifying an inverse relationship between these factors.

Plot 3: Stress Level vs. Screen Time (Green)
- Checks if people experiencing more stress also spend more hours on screens.  
- Highlights potential coping or avoidance behaviors.

Plot 4: Stress Level vs. Sleep Duration (Purple)
- Examines whether increased stress reduces the average hours of sleep.  
- Helps see if poor sleep could be linked to high stress.

## Boxplots: Stress Level vs. Key Metrics

Five boxplots to explore how stress level relates to different health indicators from both the smartwatch and mental health datasets.

1. Heart Rate by Stress Level 
   - Displays how the heart rate (BPM)varies for each stress level.  
   - Useful for spotting if highly stressed individuals tend to have an elevated heart rate.

2. Step Count by Stress Level  
   - Shows daily step count grouped by stress level.  
   - Helps indicate whether low-stress individuals are more physically active, or if high-stress leads to fewer steps.

3. Sleep Duration by Stress Level  
   - Illustrates the hours of sleep recorded by the smartwatch at each stress level.  
   - Can reveal if high stress correlates with shorter sleep.

4. Screen Time by Stress Level
   - Comes from the mental health dataset, indicating how many hours are spent on screens per day.  
   - Examines whether screen usage rises with higher stress levels.

5. Happiness Score by Stress Level  
   - Also from the mental health data, showing self-reported happiness.  
   - Highlights a potential inverse relationship between stress and happiness.

Together, these boxplots provide a quick visual comparison of multiple health and lifestyle metrics as stress levels change.

## Stress Level & Health Score by Activity Level

Here we compare stress_level and **health_score across different activity levels (Sedentary, Moderate, Highly Active, Active). This gives us a sense of whether:

- More active individuals experience lower stress on average.  
- Physical activity correlates with a higher overall health score.

By putting stress level on one plot and **health score on the other, we can see if the same activity level that lowers stress also increases health.

## Stress Level & Sleep Duration by Activity Level

These boxplots examine how stress levels and sleep duration vary with activity level. We can see if being more active is linked to:
- Lower stress levels, potentially indicating exercise helps manage stress.
- Longer sleep durations, suggesting that active individuals maintain healthier sleep habits.

### Key Takeaways
1. Health Score is significantly different across activity levels. This suggests that more active groups may have higher (or lower) health scores compared to less active groups.  
2. Stress Level, Sleep Duration, and Happiness Score do not differ significantly by activity/exercise level, based on these p-values.  
   - For stress level and happiness score, we can infer that activity level alone might not explain their variations.  
   - For sleep duration, it appears there‚Äôs no strong statistical difference among different activity groups in this dataset.

### Interpretation
- False under ‚ÄúReject Ho?‚Äù means there is no statistically significant difference between those two activity levels in terms of health_score.
- True indicates a significant difference. For instance, the active group differs significantly from moderate and sedentary, but not from highly active.

### Key Findings
1. Active & Highly Active groups show no significant difference in health score (p > 0.05).  
2. Every other comparison is significant (p < 0.05), suggesting meaningful differences in health score across those pairs of activity levels.  

In short, being active or highly active yields similar health scores, while moderate and sedentary levels are significantly lower. This aligns with our ANOVA result indicating that activity level is a strong predictor of health score.

### Ridgeline Plot: Stress Level Distribution by Activity Level

This plot shows kernel density estimates for stress levels (ranging 0‚Äì10 or 0‚Äì100) across different activity levels (Sedentary, Moderate, Highly Active, Active). Each ‚Äúlayer‚Äù is offset vertically to highlight where most data points cluster for each activity group.

- Purpose: Compare how stress is distributed among users with different activity levels.  
- Interpretation: Higher peaks indicate common stress levels for that group. Overlaps or differing peak positions can show if active users tend to report lower (or higher) stress compared to sedentary users.

### Scatter Plots: Sleep Duration vs. Heart Rate Across Activity Levels

This visualization consists of four scatter plots, each corresponding to a different activity level (Sedentary, Moderate, Highly Active, Active). The x-axis represents sleep duration (in hours), and the y-axis represents heart rate (BPM). The color gradient indicates stress levels, with darker colors representing lower stress levels and lighter colors representing higher stress levels.

- Purpose: Explore the relationship between sleep duration, heart rate, and stress across different activity groups.  
- Observations:
  - Users with shorter sleep durations (<6 hours) generally tend to have higher heart rates.
  - Individuals with longer sleep durations (~7-8 hours) tend to have lower heart rates, often associated with lower stress levels.
  - Across all activity levels, users with higher stress levels (light colors) appear to have a wider range of heart rates, potentially indicating physiological stress responses.
  - There is no drastic difference between activity levels, though highly active individuals seem to maintain more stable heart rates.

These insights suggest that sleep duration may have a significant impact on heart rate and stress levels, regardless of activity level.

### ANOVA & Tukey Test: Screen Time and Stress Level

This analysis aims to evaluate whether different categories of screen time (Low, Medium, High) significantly impact stress levels. The analysis consists of:

1. ANOVA Test (Analysis of Variance): Determines if there is a statistically significant difference in stress levels between the screen time categories.
2. Tukey‚Äôs HSD Test: A post-hoc test used when ANOVA finds a significant difference, to pinpoint which specific groups differ.

#### **ANOVA Results**
- The F-statistic is 1813.39, with a p-value of 0.0 (very significant).
- This suggests that screen time categories significantly impact stress levels.

#### **Tukey's HSD Test Results**
- High vs. Low Screen Time: The mean difference is -5.36, with a p-value < 0.05, meaning individuals with high screen time experience significantly higher stress compared to those with low screen time.
- High vs. Medium Screen Time: The mean difference is **-3.65, also statistically significant.
- Medium vs. Low Screen Time: The mean difference is **1.7, indicating medium screen time is also associated with higher stress than low screen time.

#### **Key Takeaways**
- Higher screen time is strongly linked to increased stress levels.
- There is a clear, statistically significant difference between all screen time categories.
- This suggests that reducing screen time may be a potential strategy for managing stress.

### Correlation Analysis: Key Factors Affecting Happiness & Stress

#### 1. Correlation Heatmap
The heatmap presents correlations between happiness score, stress level, sleep hours, and screen time:
- Happiness & Stress Level: Strong negative correlation (-0.82)  
- Happiness & Sleep Hours: Strong positive correlation (0.78)  
- Happiness & Screen Time: Moderate negative correlation (-0.74)  

#### 2. Scatter Plots: Key Relationships
- Happiness vs. Sleep Hours: More sleep is associated with higher happiness.
- Happiness vs. Screen Time: More screen time correlates with lower happiness.

These results suggest that stress and screen time negatively impact happiness, while sleep has a positive effect.

### Feature Importance: What Affects Happiness?

This analysis uses a Random Forest Model to determine the most influential factors impacting happiness score.

#### Model Performance
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 1.04‚Üí Low error, meaning the model predictions are relatively accurate.
- R¬≤ Score: 0.76 ‚Üí The model explains 76% of the variance in happiness.

#### **Key Factors Influencing Happiness**
The feature importance plot highlights the most impactful variables:
1. Stress Level (Strongest negative impact)
2. Social Interaction Score (Moderate positive impact)
3. Age (Slight influence)
4. Screen Time Hours (Negative impact)
5. Sleep Hours (Small positive impact)
6. Work Hours Per Week (Minimal impact)

These findings reinforce tha higher stress and excessive screen time reduce happiness, while more social interaction and sleep contribute positively.

## üìå Final Summary: Integrated Analysis of Mental and Physical Health: Links Between Lifestyle Habits and Biometric Measures 

This project explores the complex relationships between stress, sleep, physical activity, screen time, and mental well-being through biometric smartwatch data and self-reported health surveys. By analyzing these variables, we aim to identify patterns that contribute to stress reduction and improved happiness levels.

### üîé Key Findings
1Ô∏è‚É£ Activity Level and Stress  
   - Sedentary individuals show higher stress levels compared to active ones.  
   - However, excessive activity does not necessarily equate to lower stress.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ Sleep and Stress 
   - Higher stress levels are associated with reduced sleep duration.  
   - Individuals with stress levels above 7 tend to sleep less than 5 hours, reinforcing the link between chronic stress and sleep deprivation.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Heart Rate and Stress  
   - A significant correlation exists between high stress levels and increased heart rate, demonstrating the physiological burden of stress.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Screen Time and Mental Health 
   - More screen time correlates with higher stress and lower happiness.  
   - Individuals spending 6+ hours per day on screens report notably lower happiness scores.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Importance: What Drives Happiness?  
   - Stress is the most significant negative predictor of happiness.  
   - Sleep duration positively influences happiness, but to a smaller degree.  
   - Social interaction and age also impact overall well-being.  
   - Excessive screen time negatively affects happiness, reinforcing concerns about digital habits and well-being.

### üéØ **Conclusions & Next Steps
- This study confirms that stress, sleep, activity levels, and screen time significantly impact mental and physical well-being.  
- The results suggest that reducing stress, improving sleep quality, and moderating screen time are essential for better mental and physical health.  
- Future research could focus on longitudinal trends (e.g., seasonal variations in stress) or integrate additional lifestyle factors for a more comprehensive perspective.  

This project contributes to a data-driven understanding of well-being, providing actionable insights for individuals seeking to optimize their daily habits for better health outcomes.
